1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
Ans:
var is function-scoped,while let and const are block-scoped.var and let can be reassigned;const cannot.var    can be redeclared;let and const cannot.var is hoisted and initialized with undefined;let and const are hoisted but not initialized.
2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
Ans:
forEach() iterates over elements and does not return anything.map() transforms each element and returns a new array.filter() returns a new array containing elements that satisfy a condition.
3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
Ans:
Arrow functions are a shorter syntax for writing functions.They do not have their own this.Single-line arrow functions return automatically without using return.
4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
Ans:
Destructuring extracts values from arrays or objects into separate variables.It can be used with arrays, objects, or function parameters.
5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
Ans:
Template literals use backticks (``) instead of quotes.Allow embedding variables using ${variable}.Support multiline strings without using \n.Easier and cleaner than string concatenation.
